# Synopsis
This webapp describes how to build a hovercraft.  It provides an overview page,
which describes what you need to know when building a hovercraft.  A calculations
page is provided which calculates what blower specs and nozzle size are needed.
A page is also provided for those wanting to dive deeper into how the blower specs
and nozzle area are calculated.

# Motivation
My dad and I built a hovercraft while I was in high school.  It was a very enjoyable
project and the hovercraft was a lot of fun to ride.  Initially we wanted to provide
plans to build the exact hovercraft we built, but we later decided it was better
to leave that open ended.  Instead, we want to share the lessons we learned that
ultimately got our hovercraft to work as well as the calculations to get the right
blower to get it to work.
